    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Initially, when choosing our model, we looked at a variety of different diseases, before remembering an interesting discovery relating to the vaccination policy at Olin. Students are not required to receive the meningococcal meningitis if they sign a waiver acknowledging the risks of the disease. As a result, a case (albeit an unlikely one) could arise where an entire student body could choose to opt out of this vaccine, and leave themselves susceptible to an outbreak. While this assumption is valid in that it is possible, with a student body like the students at Olin, it isn’t very likely. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In regard to Olin, we standardized the population to three hundred and sixty students, and assumed that the average Olin student is in contact with 25 students per day on average. We chose these based on our own estimations of class size, and personal experiences with students interacting with others on a daily basis. Additionally, as from our limited experience with the students around us, we assumed that Olin students would continue to come to class if they felt a bit under the weather, as people tend to feel in the incubation period of meningococcal meningitis. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the biggest assumptions we had to make was in regard to the contagion rate of the disease. After much research, we discovered that there doesn’t seem to sufficient information on the rates of infection or contagion in relation to meningococcal meningitis, so we looked for other avenues of validating our rates. We instead assumed it would be accurate to base our transmission rate on that of a similarly spread disease, influenza. We multiplied the average rate of contagion of influenza  by a proportion of the lifetime of meningococcal meningitis bacteria to that of the influenza bacteria, to adjust for the actual rate of transmission.</br>"

    "## Main Limitation\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The main way this model fails to represent reality is that it is not time-dependent. In a real outbreak, a patient might go from susceptible to infected, remain in an incubation period for 4 days, and then suddenly become quarantined. All of these transitions between stocks would be discreet and there would be a time step delay between each. Instead, due to how this model represents flows as continuous functions of rates and proportions, as soon as a stock becomes populated, portions of it are immediately transferred to the next stock within the next time step. That would be analogous to a portion of a patient becoming infected, then having one fourth of that patient becoming quarantined every day for the next four days. The end result is the same, one whole patient transfers from infected to quarantined after 4 days, but it does have some effects on the models results. Namely, rather than rising continuously from the first day, the quarantine stock would remain at zero for at least the duration of the incubation period before beginning to climb. The ending survival rate would be the same, but because of this discrepancy, this model is somewhat out-of-regime."

    "## Iteration\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our iterative process resulted in some large changes to our code throughout the creation of this model. Initially, we modeled this disease as if it were more similar to the flu, with milder symptoms and a more gradual onset period. Once infected, we expected some patients to immediately quarantine themselves and the rest to be able to come to class despite the symptoms. Some of those coming to class would also eventually flow to quarantine, modeling how symptoms might become worse over time. As we wanted to model an increased risk of death if a student were to continue coming to class instead of seeking immediate treatment, we introduced new flow rates directly from “coming to class” to dead and recovered, and therefore created two parallel tracts from susceptible to recovered or dead. All in all, not only was this model more complicated than our final, it was also less accurate. </br>\n",

    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we did more research, we learned that meningococcal meningitis symptoms have two discrete phases: a relatively asymptomatic incubation phase and a rapidly onset symptomatic phase. In reality, the flu-like symptoms of the incubation phase would be so mild that there’s basically no chance anyone would seek quarantine over them, whereas the second phase would be so severe that everyone in that phase would be immediately hospitalized. Using the same stocks as before, we were able to simplify our model such that C represents those in the incubation phase, Q represents those in the second phase (hospitalized), and S only flows to C, which only flows to Q, and only those in Q can flow to dead or recovered.\n"

As the graph shows, the susceptible population drops at a proportional rate before leveling off at day 22 when there are zero people left.

As a result, the spread can be incredibly deadly, unless vaccines or quarentines are enacted on the entire population quickly."
